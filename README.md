# My-own-learning-Algorithm

In this repository, You will find my first learning algorithm based on symbolic paradigm of AI.

Thanks a lot for give me an oportunity to show you how this algorithm works. I hope It would help you to solve a clasification problem.

## Disclaming

Of course, I only designed this algorithm, the dataset, images and other things necesary to run this proyect are no all mine. Thats why, in respect to the other coders and people who made the datasets, This repository will only contain my code, the rest of requirements you will need to visit the original sources, download the tools, and follow my instructions for make this code works.

## Material

### Python

this proyect was made with **python 3.10.12**, so consider this to prevent incompatibility errors in a future.

### Dataset

This proyect was tested originally whith the dataset "Mushroom", you can find It on UCI Machine Learning Repository, or through It's DOI: [10.24432/C5959T](https://doi.org/10.24432/C5959T)

Once there, download It, move the .zip file to your local copy of this repo, create a new directory there named "src" and extract the .zip file inside the new directory

### dependencies

In order to make you quite easy the Instalation of all libs and dependencies requested  to this proyect to be used, I provide you a [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) (If you wish, you can take a look to this file) file with all this stuff included, you only need to run on console the next command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

and all will be installed on your environment (>w<>).

#### hint

Consider using conda environment if you don't want to install this libraries on your main environment

Thanks a lot for your comprehention, now go ahead and test this fantastic code!!!
